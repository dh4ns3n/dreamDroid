# Looking for a Maintainer
I am currently looking for someone to take over maintenance and potentially even the actual play store app entry of dreamdroid.
I will personally not continue development of dreamDroid.
Should there be any requirement to update it in order not to be thrown out of the play store I will remove it from the play store.

As apps can be transferred to different accounts I could think of transferring dreamDroid's play store appearance to another developer.

If you have serious interest about overtaking please contact me.

If you have serious interest about making money with my and other people's work go and f* yourself.
